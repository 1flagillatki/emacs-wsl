A final possible cause of this error is a game bug. Some users reported that this error only happens when they try to play co-op with friends who have a different version of the game. For example, if one player has the base game and another player has the Ultimate Edition, they may not be able to play together. To fix this, you need to make sure that both players have the same version of the game and that they have installed all the updates and DLCs. You can check this by comparing your game properties in Steam with your friend's game properties.
 
This solution may help you avoid compatibility issues and play co-op with your friends without getting the error. If it doesn't work for you, you may need to contact the game developer or Steam support for further assistance.
